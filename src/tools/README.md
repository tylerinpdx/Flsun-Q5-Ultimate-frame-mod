 The tolerance tester can be printed with 2 walls, any extrusion width is fine. 

Very important to print this without a brim. This is a difficult print so you can use like glue stick or whatever the you do to prevent it from warping, and minimal elephant foot as possible. 


**Important note** If you do not have pressure advance or linear advance you should use 4 walls to better simulate an actual print because of corner bulging
