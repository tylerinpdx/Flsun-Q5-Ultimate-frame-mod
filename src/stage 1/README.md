# Bill of materials, printing instructions and Install
The 2020 extrusion from the frame needs to fit inside the bottom tower support, so there are multiple tolerance versions.


The Idler pulley also has multiple tolerance versions, the pulley needs to have little play side to 
side otherwise it's going to rattle and make a lot of noise.

The Idler plate has a hole for a 35mm long M5 Fastener, that's should be the right size for the fastener to cut its own thread.
You could also use a 5 mm shaft.

## BOM for stage 1
- M5x16MM 12.9 12X  

- M5 t-nuts 12X These must be the larger size ones, not those twist-in nonsense things. 

- M4x50MM 12.9 6X Head diameter 7mm

- M4x22MM 12.9 3X head diameter 7 mm 

- **optional** but recommended M4 washer 9X   9 mm max diameter, max height 1.2mm

- M4 nut 9x

- M5x35MM 3X   The material doesn't matter as long as it's not pot metal.

- GT2 20T 5MM bearing idler 3X  very important, width is 8.5 mm 

- rubber feet that came with the printer and the fasteners that held the feet on. 

- bottom tower support heavy duty 3x  print it, 3MF is in stage one 

- idler plate 3x  print it, 3MF is in stage one 


## Printing instructions 
**You must have another printer to print the parts, Ideally a cartesian machine** 

ABS recommended, PETG minimum or annealed PLA For all parts, Due to proximity to the hot bed.

### bottom Tower support heavy duty
Quantity 3x

At least three layers top and bottom 

0.20MM layer height or 0.24MM layer height. <sup>Unless you have an extremely fast printer</sup>

Brim to help reduce warping to minimum, highly recommended

No support

(0.65MM extrusion width, 6 walls)  (0.40MM extrusion width, 9 walls)

Shown below is an example with 0.45MM extrusion width

### idler plate
Quantity 3x

 At least four bottom layers 

Brim to help reduce warping to minimum, highly recommended

(0.65MM extrusion width, 5 walls)  (0.40MM extrusion width, 8 walls)

If you do not have good part cooling you need at least 10% infill so it doesn't collapse

If you have good part cooling you probably won't need support

## Instructions

If you've already tolerance tested your other printer you can skip step 1.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
step 1

print the tolerance tester, get it along with the instructions [here](https://github.com/tylerinpdx/Flsun-Q5-Ultimate-frame-mod/tree/main/src/tools).

after printing the tolerance tester,  take all of them and try to fit them on the extrusion of the frame, you're looking for the one that it's a little bit loose but not too loose 

Example shown below <sup> obviously your machine won't be the same </sup>

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

step 2

After determining which one fit the best. 

Each Torrance test has a number that is the tolerance In millimeters, which corresponds with a file .3mf  

Print the one that fit the best
