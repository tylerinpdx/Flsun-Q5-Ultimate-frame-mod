The squishy wobbly motion system on the Q5 left a lot to be desired.

Even after removing at least 130g of moving mass, which made almost no difference
I was not satisfied especially for it being a small lightweight Delta 

I couldn't go above ~~3100~~ 1500 accel 3mm/s SCV without excessive low frequency ringing (33hz for X and 36hz for Y with 2 hump ei!!)  

among other problems like the belt coming off the Idler and idler being bent upwards 

you will lose 12mm at the absolute most of build height, I lost 8mm

TLDR  this mod drastically improves frame stiffness now you have a tooth idler that won't break off
